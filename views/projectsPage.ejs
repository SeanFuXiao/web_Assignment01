                <p>In my second semester, I actively participated in a campus 
                    navigation app development project. The app aimed to help 
                    students and visitors navigate our university campus more easily. 
                    My responsibilities included front-end and back-end development, 
                    creating interactive maps, navigation features, campus location information,
                     and a user feedback system. This project made campus navigation more convenient 
                     and provided a valuable tool for the campus community.</p>

                <p>In the third semester, I took part in a travel planning app development project.
                     The goal of the app was to assist users in easily creating personalized travel plans.
                      I was responsible for front-end design and user experience, as well as back-end logic development, 
                      including travel destination recommendations, itinerary planning,
                       dining and accommodation suggestions. This project provided travelers with a
                        convenient platform to plan unforgettable journeys.</p>

                <p>I've always had a passion for car modifications, so I started a personal project to 
                    develop a car modification app. This app aims to connect car modification enthusiasts 
                    and allow them to share their modification projects and experiences. I was responsible 
                    for end-to-end development, including user registration, uploading modification photos, 
                    discussion forums, modification parts catalog, and user social features. This project 
                    is a combination of my personal passion and technical interest, aiming to build a passionate 
                    car modification community.</p>
